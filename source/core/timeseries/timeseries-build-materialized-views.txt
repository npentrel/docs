.. PLEASE IGNORE FOR NOW
.. Users will be able to build materialized views in v1 via $merge or $out commands as they would for other collections.
.. Users will not be able to natively schedule the refreshing of these materialized views.
.. Users will need to run their own cron jobs or manually refresh these views
.. Materialized views will be used for archiving, different data access pattern management and analytics use cases

.. For example:
.. Aggregate sales for 5 minute windows
.. Create a view for the data science team to run analysis on
.. Archive all data older than 5 minutes
.. Users will not have access to “real-time” analytics in v1
